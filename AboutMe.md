# Bhavishya Yarapathineni
This is Bhavishya Yarapathineni from Guntur, India. I have been brought up in Guntur. I have completed my schooling in Sri Chaitanya Techno School in Guntur. Recently I completed my bachelor's in civil engineering from R.V.R&J.C College of Engineering. I spend my leisure time by watching k-dramas and chinese dramas. One of my favourite drama is put your head on my shoulder. I really like to hangout with my family and friends.
