# Algebra
###### Algebra from another source code
> Algebra (from Arabic: الجبر, romanized: al-jabr, lit.'reunion of broken parts, bonesetting') is one of the broad areas of mathematics. Roughly speaking, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics.

long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
    if (b == 0)
        return 1;
    long long res = binpow(a, b / 2);
    if (b % 2)
        return res * res * a;
    else
        return res * res;
}
